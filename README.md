<h1>Executive Sales & Performance Management Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Designed and implemented an end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI to provide executive management with a dynamic sales dashboard. The project involved connecting to and cleaning disparate raw CSV files, constructing a robust Star Schema data model, and applying complex DAX calculations to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) like Revenue, Profit, and Returns. The final product enabled real-time, interactive analysis of regional performance, product-level trends, and the identification of high-value customers, successfully transitioning reporting from static files to self-service analytics.
